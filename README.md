## Overview

I like finding UI controls that normally have JavaScript with them and see if I can create a pure C# control to using with my Blazor applications.  I found a cool Accordion control so I converted to a generic C# Blazor control

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

2. Open the Project:
   In Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
   If using Visual Studio Code, make sure to install the C# extensions.

3. Run the Application:
Press F5 to start the application.

## Features

1, Accordion Control Implementation: The project includes a generic C# Accordion control leveraging RenderFragments to customize accordion content.
